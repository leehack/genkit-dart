/// Async sub-agent delegation demo — the `agents(async: true)` middleware.
///
/// The orchestrator delegates independent research tasks to a `researcher`
/// sub-agent in the *background*: each delegation returns a `taskId`
/// immediately, so the orchestrator can fan several out and then collect them
/// with `wait_for_background_tasks` instead of blocking on each in turn. Both
/// sub-agents are server-managed (they have a session store), which is what
/// makes background delegation and `continue_task` possible.
///
/// Run it (capturing a trace) with:
///
///   . ~/init-gemini.sh && \
///     genkit start -- dart run bin/async_agent_sample.dart
///
/// then inspect the trace:
///
///   genkit trace:list
///   genkit trace:get `<traceId>` --format=json
