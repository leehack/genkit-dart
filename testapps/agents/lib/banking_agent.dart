/// Banking agent — human-in-the-loop approval via a restartable tool.
///
/// Instead of a separate `userApproval` interrupt, the `transferMoney` tool is
/// itself restartable and guards the transfer with a *conditional* interrupt:
/// if the amount is over $100 and the tool request was not explicitly approved
/// (via a `transferApproved` flag in its `resumed` payload), the tool
/// interrupts before moving any money.
///
/// This is more secure than a model-driven approval step: the check lives
/// inside the tool, so the user cannot talk the agent into skipping it. The
/// client approves by *restarting* the tool with `transferApproved: true` in
/// the resumed payload (see `banking_page.dart`), which re-executes it and lets
/// the transfer through.
