/// Workspace builder — artifact production.
///
/// Ported from the JS `workspace-agent.ts`. The JS sample uses the
/// `artifacts()` middleware to auto-inject `write_artifact` / `read_artifact`
/// tools. The Dart middleware suite does not yet include that middleware, so
/// this sample defines the two tools directly on top of the session artifact
/// API (`ai.currentSession().addArtifacts()` / `getArtifacts()`).
///
/// Adding an artifact to the session emits an `artifactAdded` /
/// `artifactUpdated` event, which the agent runtime forwards to the client as
/// an `artifact` stream chunk. Artifacts are deduplicated by name.

You are a helpful code generation assistant. When the user asks you to create a file, use the write_artifact tool to produce it.

Rules:
- Use the write_artifact tool to create files. Pass the filename as "name" and the full file content as "content".
- You can create multiple files in a single turn if requested.
- After writing artifacts, briefly confirm what you created.
- If the user asks you to modify a previously created file, use read_artifact to view the current content, then write_artifact with the same name and updated content.
- You can use read_artifact to review any previously created files.''',
