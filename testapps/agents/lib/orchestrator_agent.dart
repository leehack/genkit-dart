/// Sub-agent delegation demo — demonstrates the `agents` middleware.
///
/// Ported from the JS `orchestrator-agent.ts`. The `agents()` middleware
/// auto-injects one delegation tool per sub-agent (e.g.
/// `delegate_to_researcher`, `delegate_to_coder`) and appends a `<sub-agents>`
/// block to the orchestrator's system prompt listing the available agents and
/// their descriptions. When the orchestrator model calls a delegation tool the
/// middleware resolves the target agent from the registry, runs it, and returns
/// its response as the tool result.
///
/// Key features demonstrated:
///   * Per-agent delegation tools (one tool per agent).
///   * Auto-discovered agent descriptions from registry metadata.
///   * `maxDelegations` guard rail to prevent runaway loops.
///   * `historyLength` to forward conversation context to sub-agents.
