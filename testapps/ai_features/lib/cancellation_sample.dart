/// Demonstrates cooperative cancellation of a `generate` call.

/// A [CancellationController] is created by the caller; its [CancellationToken]
/// is passed into `generate` / `generateStream` via the `cancel:` parameter.
/// Calling `controller.cancel()` aborts the in-flight model call (and the whole
/// tool loop). Rather than throwing, `generate` resolves with a response whose
/// `finishReason` is [FinishReason.aborted]; `response.messages` carries the
/// last-good history so you can attempt to resume from there.
