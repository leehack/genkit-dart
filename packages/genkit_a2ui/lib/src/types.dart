/// Shared A2UI protocol types and constants.

/// This module is intentionally free of any server-only dependencies so it can
/// be imported both on the server (the `a2ui()` middleware) and on the client
/// (the transport helpers, including Flutter). It mirrors the wire shapes of the
/// A2UI v0.9 specification.
///
/// Envelopes are represented as plain `Map<String, dynamic>` values (their raw
/// JSON shape), since they are open-ended and pass straight through to the
/// renderer. The constants and helpers here document and construct those shapes.
