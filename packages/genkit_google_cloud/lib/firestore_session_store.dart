/// Unlike the JS port (which uses Firestore's live `onSnapshot` listener), the
/// Dart Firestore client has no real-time listener, so
/// [onSnapshotStateChange] is implemented by polling. Tune the latency via the
/// `snapshotWatchPollInterval` constructor argument.
///
/// ## Project ID
///
/// The default [Firestore] instance uses Application Default Credentials, but
/// ADC alone does not always carry a project ID. If the client cannot discover
/// one it throws at read/write time with "Project ID has not been discovered
/// yet". To avoid this, either set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment
/// variable (often required even when ADC is present) or pass an explicit
/// [Firestore] instance configured with a project ID to the constructor.

  ///   not carry a project ID; set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` or pass an explicit

  ///   from it: `"<collection>-pointers"` and `"<collection>-shards"`.

  /// - [shardSize]: maximum size in bytes of a single shard / diff document.
  ///   Defaults to [defaultShardSize].
  /// - [snapshotPathPrefix]: returns a per-tenant prefix derived from the
  ///   call's `context` (e.g. the authenticated user id). When set, all
  ///   snapshot, pointer and shard documents are nested under a tenant-scoped
  ///   subcollection keyed by this prefix, isolating reads and writes per
  ///   tenant. Defaults to `"global"`.
