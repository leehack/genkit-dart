// Background delegation for the agents middleware (the `async` option).
//
// A background delegation launches the sub-agent with `AgentInput.detach`: the
// runtime persists a pending snapshot, returns its ID at once, and keeps
// running the turn decoupled from this tool call. The pending snapshot is the
// durable record of the task: it is heartbeated while the worker lives,
// finalized in place with the cumulative session state when the work settles,
// and surfaced as `expired` by readers once the heartbeat goes stale.
//
// The middleware keeps no task registry. The task handle
// ("<agent>:<snapshotId>") is self-contained and rides in the tool result, so
// it is recorded in the orchestrator's conversation history; a re-instantiated
// orchestrator resumes tracking from the IDs in its history. Status goes
// through the sub-agent's snapshot/abort companion actions: check reads the
// row, abort flips a pending row to aborting, and wait polls the row until it
// settles.
//
// Unlike the Go port there is no blocking wait companion action, so
// `wait_for_background_tasks` polls the snapshot on an interval (the same
// strategy the runtime own DetachedTask.wait uses) rather than a single
// blocking dispatch.
