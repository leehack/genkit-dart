// Task continuation for the agents middleware.
//
// A delegation that settled leaves a handle behind ("<agent>:<snapshotId>",
// see AgentDelegationResult.taskId), and the sub-agent runtime makes the
// snapshot behind it a resume point: a failed or aborted run holds the state
// through its last committed turn, and a completed run holds the whole
// conversation. The shared continue tool spends that handle: it retries a
// failed or aborted task from its saved progress (an empty instructions field
// re-attempts the turn as committed; a non-empty one steers the retry), and
// follows up on a completed task inside the sub-agent's own session.
//
// Only server-managed sub-agents (those with a session store) are continuable.
// A client-managed delegation settles inline and leaves nothing durable a
// handle could name, so its result carries no taskId, and redoing its work
// means delegating again.
